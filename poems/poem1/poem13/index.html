    <p>He manages like somebody carrying a box
that is too heavy, first with his arms
underneath.</p>

 <p>When their strength gives out,
he moves the hands forward, hooking them
on the corners, pulling the weight against
his chest.</p>

<p>He moves his thumbs slightly
when the fingers begin to tire, and it makes
different muscles take over.</p>

<p>Afterward,he carries it on his shoulder, until the blood
drains out of the arm that is stretched up
to steady the box and the arm goes numb.</p>

<p>But now the man can hold underneath again, so that
he can go on without ever putting the box down.</p>
