    <h1>Michiko Dead</h1>
    <h3>By Jack Gilbert</h3>
    <p> He manages like somebody carrying a box<br>
that is too heavy, first with his arms<br>
underneath. When their strength gives out,<br>
he moves the hands forward, hooking them<br>
on the corners, pulling the weight against<br>
his chest. He moves his thumbs slightly<br>
when the fingers begin to tire, and it makes<br>
different muscles take over. Afterward,<br>
he carries it on his shoulder, until the blood<br>
drains out of the arm that is stretched up<br>
to steady the box and the arm goes numb. But now<br>
the man can hold underneath again, so that<br>
he can go on without ever putting the box down.</p>
