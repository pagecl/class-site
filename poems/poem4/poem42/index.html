  <p><small>He <big>manages</big> like somebody <big>carrying</big> a box
that is too heavy, first with <big>his arms</big>
underneath. When their strength gives out,
he moves the <big>hands</big> forward, hooking them
on the corners, <big>pulling</big> the weight against
his chest. He moves his thumbs slightly
when the fingers begin to tire, and it makes
<big>different muscles</big> take over. Afterward,
he carries it on his shoulder, <big>until</big> the blood
drains out of the arm that is stretched up
to steady the box and <big>the arm goes numb.</big> But now
the man can hold underneath again, so that
<big>he can go on</big> without ever putting the box down.</small></p>
