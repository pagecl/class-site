    <p><big><strong>Michiko Dead</strong></big></p>
    <p><em>By Jack Gilbert</em></p>
    <p><big>He manages like somebody carrying a box
  that is too heavy,<br> first with his <strong>arms</strong>
  underneath. When their strength gives out,<br>
  he moves the <strong>hands</strong> forward, hooking them
  on the corners,<br> pulling the weight against
  his <strong>chest.</strong> He moves his <strong>thumbs</strong><br> slightly
  when the <strong>fingers</strong> begin to tire, and it makes
  different<br> <strong>muscles</strong> take over. Afterward,
  he carries it on his <strong>shoulder,</strong><br> until the blood
  drains out of the <strong>arm</strong> that is stretched up
  to<br> steady the box and the <strong>arm</strong> goes numb. But now
  the man<br> can hold underneath again, so that
  he can go on without ever<br> putting the box down.</big></p>
