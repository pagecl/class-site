    <p><em>Michiko Dead</em></p>
    <p><small>He manages like somebody carrying a box
  that is too heavy, first with his <em>arms</em>
  underneath. When their strength gives out,
  he moves the <em>hands</em> forward, hooking them
  on the corners, pulling the weight against
  his <em>chest.</em> He moves his <em>thumbs</em> slightly
  when the <em>fingers</em> begin to tire, and it makes
  different <em>muscles</em> take over. Afterward,
  he carries it on his <em>shoulder,</em> until the blood
  drains out of the <em>arm</em> that is stretched up
  to steady the box and the <em>arm</em> goes numb. But now
  the man can hold underneath again, so that
  he can go on without ever putting the box down.</small></p>
