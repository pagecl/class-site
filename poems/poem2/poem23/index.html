    <h1>Michiko Dead &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>By Jack Gilbert</small></h1>
    <h2> He manages like somebody carrying a box
that is too heavy, first with his arms
underneath.</h2> <h3>When their strength gives out,
he moves the hands forward, hooking them
on the corners, pulling the weight against
his chest.</h3> <h4> He moves his thumbs slightly
when the fingers begin to tire, and it makes
different muscles take over.</h4> Afterward,<br>
he carries it on his shoulder, until the blood<br>
drains out of the arm that is stretched up<br>
to steady the box and the arm goes numb. But now<br>
the man can hold underneath again, so that<br>
he can go on without ever putting the box down.</p>
